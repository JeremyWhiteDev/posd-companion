# Philosophy of Software Design Companion

Philosophy of Software Design is a book written by John Ousterhout. While the book's content includes demonstrations of its concepts, it lacks clear practical prompts or "exercise problems".

It is too easy to read a book like this passively, agree with the guidelines it lays out, and move on without actually engaging and learning from what it teaches.

This Companion guide provides that engagement, and includes: chapter summaries, key takeaways, and most importanty, Exercise Problems in order to actually practice the methods as laid out in this book.

### What to Expect in this Companion

Each Chapter directory will include the following

```
posd-companion/
├─ chapter-01/
│  ├─ summary.md
│  ├─ practice.md
│  ├─ solutions.js

```

Some chapters are very short, and may not include `practice` and `solutions` files.

All of this content is written by me (no gen AI) to understand the principles laid out in this book at a deeper level.
The provided solutions are written in Javascript. Of course, my "solutions" are only a single approach.
